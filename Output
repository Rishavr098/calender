>>>>  Application in C <<<<

The Calendar in C Programming is a Calendar Project In C that helps you find the date and day you need by being built in the C programming language. It also does a few other tasks. A C-written calendar application may offer information going back to the late 1600s. By just entering the values, you may also get the results for the day. Another choice is to include notes. 

>>>>  Describe the Calendar <<<<

It is a day-planning technique. This is done by giving names to certain time periods, most frequently days, weeks, months, and years. A date in such a system designates a single, particular day. A calendar is a tangible representation of such a system (typically made of paper). A calendar can also refer to a list of forthcoming occasions, such as a court calendar, or a collection of documents that are largely or entirely chronological, such as a wills calendar.
